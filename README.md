## Experiences and Ideas:

|Program|Description|
|---|---|
|Java Database (School Project)| Database emulated the Yelp Database for Restaurant information alongside its associated reviews and the reviewers who left said review. <br/><br/>  Personal work involved the creation of the Java database structure itself and a JSON parser (using various libraries) that put parsed information into the fields of objects of user-defined data classes (restaurant (reviewee), review, and reviewer) which were then stored in the database. <br/><br/> In addition, work was done on a k-means data clustering function which grouped all the restaurants stored in the database based on their location. <br/><br/> |
|Py_RPG (Personal Project)| Creation of a simple RPG in Python 3. Includes a basic character creation system, character stats, battle & leveling mechanics, alongside randomly generated enemies that accompany said mechanics. <br/><br/>  |
